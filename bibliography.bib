              recent research has revealed significant functional differences
              between yeasts and mammalian cells, and even among diverse yeast

              as currently unresolved questions, and provides a genomic

              engineering. They are intrinsically robust and easy to manipulate
              and cultivate. However, their secretory pathway is not
              evolutionarily adapted to high loads of secretory protein. In
              particular, more complex proteins, like the antibody fragment
              (Fab) used in this study, overwhelm the folding and secretion
              capacity. This triggers cellular stress responses, which may
              cause excessive intracellular degradation. Previous results have
              shown that, in fact, about 60 \% of the newly synthesized Fab is
              intracellularly degraded. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated
              protein degradation (ERAD) is one possible intracellular

              sequences or transmembrane domains by the signal recognition
              particle (SRP). Notably, the SRP has low abundance relative to

  abstract = "Therapeutic antibodies have essentially been banned from the
              central nervous system, and are so far limited to use mainly in
              multiple sclerosis. This is primarily due to the fact that
              antibody penetration across the blood-brain barrier is very
              limited, with about only 0.1\% of circulating antibodies
              estimated to reach the brain at steady-state concentration.
              Nonetheless, advances are being made with conventional
              antibodies, showing that minimal exposure can act centrally to
              mediate therapeutic effects. Immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease
              is a noteworthy example where antibodies against amyloid-$\beta$
              are able to reduce brain plaque pathology in preclinical models
              and humans. However, the advances in using antibodies directed at
              brain targets have also demonstrated impediments of low brain

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Real-world data quantifying the costs of increasing
              use of biologics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are unknown.
              AIM: To determine the outpatient IBD drug utilization trends,
              relative market share, and costs in the USA during a 9-year
              period. METHODS: The Truven MarketScan\textregistered{} Database
              was analysed for patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and
              ulcerative colitis (UC) during 2007-2015. National drug codes
              were used to identify prescription drugs; Healthcare Common
              Procedure Coding System J-codes were used to capture biologic
              out-patient infusions. Proportion of drug usage, relative market
              share and per-member per-year (PMPY) costs were analysed for
              biologics, immunomodulators, 5-ASAs and corticosteroids. RESULTS:
              In 415 405 patients (188 842 CD; 195 183 UC; 31 380 indeterminate
              colitis; 54.67\% female), utilization trends show a consistent
              rise in the market share of biologics during the 9-year study
              period. The proportion of patients using biologics increased from
              21.8\% to 43.8\% for CD and 5.1\%-16.2\% for UC. This contrasts a
              small decrease in immunomodulator and 5-ASA use for CD and
              relative constancy of other classes including
              corticosteroids-only use as primary IBD medication from 2007 to
              2015. The average biologic-taking patient accounted for $25 275
              PMPY in 2007 and $36 051 PMPY in 2015. The average paediatric
              biologic-taking patient accounted for $23 616 PMPY in 2007 and
              $41 109 PMPY in 2015. In all patients, the share of costs for
              biologics increased from 72.9\% in 2007 to 85.7\% in 2015 (81.7\%
              in 2007 to 94.9\% in 2015 in paediatrics). CONCLUSION: The vast
              majority of costs allocated to out-patient IBD medications in the
              USA is attributed to increasing use of biologic therapies despite
              the relative minority of biologic-taking patients.",

              objectives included assessment of adverse events, antidrug
              antibodies, and factors contributing to treatment
              discontinuation. Design, Setting, and Participants: This ongoing,
              randomized open-label extension trial (OSLER-1) was conducted at
              192 sites in 18 countries. A total of 1324 of 1666 patients

              studies completed a parent study and chose to participate in
              OSLER-1; 1255 received 1 or more evolocumab doses. As of August
              2016, 812 of 1324 (61\%) had 208 weeks of follow-up. This current
              study was conducted from October 2011 to August 2016, with a data
              cutoff of August 26, 2016. Interventions: During year 1, patients
              were randomized to evolocumab, 420 mg, plus standard of care
              (SOC) or SOC alone. After year 1, all patients continuing the
              study received evolocumab, 420 mg, plus SOC. Main Outcomes and
              Measures: Lipids, safety, and tolerability every 12 weeks. A
              multivariate model identified factors associated with
              discontinuation of evolocumab. Results: At parent study baseline,
              the mean (SD) age of the population was 57.1 (11.6) years, with
              52.9\% being women. The median LDL-C level was 133 mg/dL (to
              convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). After 52
              weeks, evolocumab plus SOC was associated with a significant
              reduction in LDL-C level by 61\% (95\% CI, -63\% to -60\%) vs 2\%
              (95\% CI, -5\% to -0.2\%) with SOC alone (P < .001). At
              approximately 2, 3, and 4 years of study follow-up, the median
              LDL-C level was reduced by 59\% (95\% CI, -60\% to -57\%), 59\%
              (95\% CI, -61\% to -58\%), and 57\% (95\% CI, -59\% to -55\%),
              respectively, from parent study baseline. For patients receiving
              statin therapy unchanged from baseline, at week 208, the median
              LDL-C level reduction was 58\%. No neutralizing antibodies to
              evolocumab were detected. The annualized incidence of new-onset
              diabetes was 4\% in the SOC alone group and, adjusting for
              duration of evolocumab exposure, 2.8\% in the evolocumab plus SOC
              group. Neurocognitive event rates were 0\% (SOC alone) and 0.4\%
              (evolocumab plus SOC). A total of 79\% of patients persisted with
              evolocumab treatment, with a mean exposure duration of 44 months.
              Conclusions and Relevance: In the longest clinical trial exposure
              to a PCSK9 inhibitor to date, evolocumab produced sustained
              reductions in LDL-C levels. The annual frequency of adverse

              It can be easily cultured at an economic price. Today the
              introduction of safe and efficient carriers is being considered.
              Due to its generally round shape, and the volume that is enclosed
              by its membrane and cell wall, it is used to encapsulate active
              materials to protect them from degradation or to introduce a

              conditions in order to achieve the best morphological properties

              research, the most suitable growth condition of yeast cells which
              provides the best size for use as drug carriers was found by a
              bioreactor in a synthetic culture medium. Yeast cell reproduction
              and growth curves were obtained, based on pour plate colony
              counting data and UV/Visible sample absorption at 600 nm. Yeast
              cell growth patterns and growth rates were determined by Matlab
              mathematical software. RESULTS: Results showed that pH=4 and
              dissolving oxygen (DO) 5\% was the best condition for yeast cells
              to grow and reproduce. This condition also provided the largest

              strategies and medium supplementation with certain amino acids

              alternative to improve the acetate tolerance of E. coli BL21

              this work we reported the cultivation of BL21 (DE3) in complex
              media containing acetate at high concentrations. In the presence
              of 300 mM acetate, compared with pH 6.5, pH 7.5 improved cell
              growth by approximately 71\%, reduced intracellular acetate by
              approximately 50\%, and restored the expression of glutathione
              S-transferase (GST), green fluorescent protein (GFP) and
              cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP). Further experiments showed
              that alkaline pHs up to 8.5 had little inhibition in the
              expression of GST, GFP and CYP. In addition, the detrimental

              coli BL21 (DE3) at pH 8.0 $\pm$ 0.5 to minimize the effects
              caused by acetate stress. The proposed strategy of an alkaline pH

              improved by these techniques, we performed massively parallel
              sequencing to identify mutations in the genomes of two
              hyperproducing strains (NG14, and its direct improved descendant,
              RUT C30). We detected a surprisingly high number of mutagenic
              events: 223 single nucleotides variants, 15 small deletions or
              insertions, and 18 larger deletions, leading to the loss of more
              than 100 kb of genomic DNA. From these events, we report
              previously undocumented non-synonymous mutations in 43 genes that

              relevance in proteomics research. Many machine learning methods
              have been successfully applied in this task, but in most of them,
              predictions rely on annotation of homologues from knowledge
              databases. For novel proteins where no annotated homologues
              exist, and for predicting the effects of sequence variants, it is
              desirable to have methods for predicting protein properties from
              sequence information only. Results: Here, we present a prediction
              algorithm using deep neural networks to predict protein
              subcellular localization relying only on sequence information. At
              its core, the prediction model uses a recurrent neural network
              that processes the entire protein sequence and an attention
              mechanism identifying protein regions important for the
              subcellular localization. The model was trained and tested on a
              protein dataset extracted from one of the latest UniProt
              releases, in which experimentally annotated proteins follow more
              stringent criteria than previously. We demonstrate that our model

              length. Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to
              process such data at scale, which presses for the development of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The impact of gene annotation quality on functional
              and comparative genomics makes gene prediction an important
              process, particularly in non-model species, including many fungi.
              Sets of homologous protein sequences are rarely complete with
              respect to the fungal species of interest and are often small or
              unreliable, especially when closely related species have not been
              sequenced or annotated in detail. In these cases, protein
              homology-based evidence fails to correctly annotate many genes,
              or significantly improve ab initio predictions. Generalised
              hidden Markov models (GHMM) have proven to be invaluable tools in
              gene annotation and, recently, RNA-seq has emerged as a
              cost-effective means to significantly improve the quality of
              automated gene annotation. As these methods do not require sets
              of homologous proteins, improving gene prediction from these
              resources is of benefit to fungal researchers. While many
              pipelines now incorporate RNA-seq data in training GHMMs, there
              has been relatively little investigation into additionally
              combining RNA-seq data at the point of prediction, and room for
              improvement in this area motivates this study. RESULTS:
              CodingQuarry is a highly accurate, self-training GHMM fungal gene
              predictor designed to work with assembled, aligned RNA-seq
              transcripts. RNA-seq data informs annotations both during
              gene-model training and in prediction. Our approach capitalises
              on the high quality of fungal transcript assemblies by
              incorporating predictions made directly from transcript
              sequences. Correct predictions are made despite transcript
              assembly problems, including those caused by overlap between the
              transcripts of adjacent gene loci. Stringent benchmarking against
              high-confidence annotation subsets showed CodingQuarry predicted
              91.3\% of Schizosaccharomyces pombe genes and 90.4\% of
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes perfectly. These results are 4-5\%
              better than those of AUGUSTUS, the next best performing RNA-seq
              driven gene predictor tested. Comparisons against whole genome
              Sc. pombe and S. cerevisiae annotations further substantiate a
              4-5\% improvement in the number of correctly predicted genes.
              CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the success of a novel method of
              incorporating RNA-seq data into GHMM fungal gene prediction. This
              shows that a high quality annotation can be achieved without
              relying on protein homology or a training set of genes.

              poly-adenylated transcripts or targeted depletion of the rRNA
              fraction. The latter method is of particular interest because it
              is compatible with degraded samples such as those extracted from
              FFPE and also captures transcripts that are not poly-adenylated
              such as some non-coding RNAs. Here we provide a cross-site study

              widely distributed in the biosphere especially in plants and

              yeast is the chief strain used for the production and
              purification of the enzyme. Invertase in nature exists in
              different isoforms. In yeasts, it is present either as
              extracellular Invertase or intracellular Invertase. In plants,
              there are three isoforms each differing in biochemical properties
              and subcellular locations. Invertase in plants is essential not
              only for metabolism but also help in osmoregulation, development
              and defence system. In humans, the enzyme acts as an immune
              booster, as an anti-oxidant, an antiseptic and helpful for bone

              form of that amino acid, in this case deuterated leucine

              is no different from growth in normal media as evidenced by cell
              morphology, doubling time, and ability to differentiate. Complete
              incorporation of Leu-d3 occurred after five doublings in the cell

              targeted silencing of transcription in bacteria and human cells.
              The CRISPRi system is derived from the Streptococcus pyogenes
              CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats)
              pathway, requiring only the coexpression of a catalytically

              (sgRNA). The Cas9-sgRNA complex binds to DNA elements
              complementary to the sgRNA and causes a steric block that halts
              transcript elongation by RNA polymerase, resulting in the
              repression of the target gene. Here we provide a protocol for the
